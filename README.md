A robust Python3 password generator.  It checks to make sure it doesn't generate any duplicate passwords, as well as screens the output against the OWASP 10 million password list Top 10,000 to avoid accidentally creating a commonly used password.  It also allows for saving the produced passwords to a file (output.txt).

Notes: If there is an existing output.txt in the folder main.py is run in, it will be overwritten if output saving is selected.
